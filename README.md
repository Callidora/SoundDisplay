# SoundDisplay
The microphone of the PC obtains sound information.
Anlu's FPGA generates snowflakes on the screen based on the sound information.




Inspired by ssfx.

How to produce the snowflakes:
The snowflakes produces by the time.Each clock pulse arrives, part of the area is white and the other part is black. The next clock pulse arrives, the black and white area changes. Due to the short clock period,human eyes see the changing snowflakes. If the clock period is increased,the pattern gradually transforms into stripes.
The area of the black and white is generated by the counter. Each clock arrives, the counter is incremented. The value of the counter is used to take the modulus value of the horizontal and vertical resolution to generate random numbers of 0-1279 and 0-1023, then generating a random black and white area.
